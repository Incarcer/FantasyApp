# THIS IS CRITICAL for your Yahoo App Registration and the backend's OAuth flow:
# This is the Redirect URI you MUST register in your Yahoo Developer Network application settings.
# For the `yahoofantasy login` CLI tool to work on your HOST: It MUST be `https://localhost:8000`.
# If your *backend* (inside Docker) initiates an OAuth flow, it will need a matching redirect URI,
# which from the backend's perspective will be `https://backend:8443/auth/yahoo/callback`.
# However, Yahoo often requires the URI in their system to be a publicly resolvable or `localhost` IP.
# So, the common setup is to use `https://localhost:8443/auth/yahoo/callback` in Yahoo's config
# and ensure your backend service's code (in api_server/routers/auth.py or similar) uses that URL.
# The variable below is for the `yahoofantasy login` CLI tool which runs on your host machine.
YAHOO_REDIRECT_URI="https://localhost:8000"

# --- IMPORTANT: DO NOT STORE YAHOO ACCESS/REFRESH TOKENS IN .ENV ---
# These tokens (YAHOO_ACCESS_TOKEN, YAHOO_GUID, YAHOO_REFRESH_TOKEN, YAHOO_TOKEN_TIME, YAHOO_TOKEN_TYPE)
# are managed by the `yahoofantasy` SDK (via the `yahoo_oauth` library).
# They are automatically saved to a local file (e.g., `~/.yahoofantasy/.token_store.json` or `oauth2.json`)
# after you run `yahoofantasy login`.
# Storing them directly in .env is insecure and bypasses the SDK's token refresh mechanism.
# Please remove these lines from your .env file if they are present.
